        <p> My name is Emma Weber and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I'm
            currently in a 12 week Full Stack, full-time coding boot camp at
            the University of Denver. After a few years working for a start
            up in downtown Denver I've decided to change career paths and
            challenge myself to try something new! My interest in coding was
            encouraged by a project I worked on with the Eng team in my most
            recent position--the colors, the layering, the ability to build
            something with creativity and skill, all caught my attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always had a knack for problem solving whether it was finding the answer to a riddle, figuring out who the killer was in 'Criminal Minds' before the episode was over, or how to pack a U-haul perfectly with all of my belongings. There is also a creative spark in me that I can't ignore. I dabble with typography, wish I could be Joanna Gaines, and make homemade Christmas cards for friends and family. These two interests have melded together in how I code. I thrive when solving problems on the back end and can spend hours perfecting my CSS.
        </p>

         A few fun facts about me:
            <ul>
            <li>I'm Native to Colorado but grew up in Texas and
                Washington</li><br>
            <li>My go-to karaoke song is Money Maker by Ludacris</li><br>
            <li>A favorite activity of mine is spending 4 hours making
                homemade cinnamon rolls</li><br>
            <li>I believe that a good, 6oz cappuccino is the true sign of
                great coffee shop</li>
            </ul>
